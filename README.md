# Hospitality Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

This project involves the development of an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) for the hospitality industry. The goal was to provide actionable insights into sales, revenue, profit, and regional performance through effective data visualization and modeling.

## Project Goal

To create a comprehensive dashboard that allows stakeholders to easily understand business performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions regarding hospitality operations.

## Key Metrics Analyzed

* **Total Revenue:** Overall income generated.
* **Total Profit:** Revenue minus costs.
* **Profit Margin:** Percentage of revenue that translates into profit.
* **Regional Performance:** Analysis of revenue, profit, and other metrics across different geographical areas.
* **Sales Trends:** Tracking sales performance over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
* **Average Daily Rate (ADR), Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), Booking Channels.**

## Tools Used

* **Microsoft Power BI:** The primary tool for data import, transformation, modeling, and visualization.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used within Power BI to create calculated columns, measures, and custom tables for complex analysis (e.g., calculating profit margins, time intelligence functions).
* **Data Source:** Data was sourced from Keggle"

## Dashboard Features

* **Interactive Visualizations:** Charts, graphs, and slicers allowing users to filter and explore data dynamically.
* **Data Modeling:** Relationships defined between different data tables (e.g., bookings, customer details, location data) to enable integrated analysis.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Clear display of critical metrics.
* **Actionable Insights:** Visual reports designed to highlight trends, outliers, and areas for improvement.

## How to View

  **Power BI Desktop File:** The core of this project is the `.pbix` file (e.g., `Hospitality_Dashboard.pbix`). This file contains the data model, queries, DAX measures, and report visuals.
  **Note:** You need Power BI Desktop installed (available for free from Microsoft) to open and interact with the `.pbix` file.


## Files in this Directory

* `README.md`: This file.
* `Hospitality-Analytics.pbix`: (You need to add this file) The Power BI Desktop file containing the dashboard.
* `hotel_bookings/`: Directory containing anonymized or sample data used for the dashboard.
